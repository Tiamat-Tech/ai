# Northbeam Outfitters – Jamie  
**Date:** 2025-XX-XX

## Executive Summary
Northbeam Outfitters is a strong 'Hot' opportunity with excellent ICP alignment and clear, high-value needs around automating returns, forecasting, and integration across Shopify Plus, NetSuite, and Redline Logistics. The buyer committee (ops/COO/CFO) is highly engaged, with an adequate budget and clarity on pilot milestones. Core pains include high return rates (18.7–24%), manual spreadsheet workflows, slow refunds, and low resellability. Top risks are security/legal review and integration friction with Redline WMS. With a pilot targeted to start in 45–60 days, success hinges on prompt legal/security clearance, technical validation, and a phased rollout that avoids Q4 warehouse disruption.

| Field           | Details                                                                                                                        |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Budget**      | Adequate – Low-to-mid five figures annually for SaaS; pilot budget up to $40k (committee-approved)                            |
| **Authority**   | Decision by committee: Jamie (Ops, main), Nora (COO), Marta (CFO); IT and warehouse leads advise                              |
| **Need**        | Strong – Returns eroding margins, manual/slow processes, resellability and forecasting urgent for profitability               |
| **Timing**      | Target pilot start in 45–60 days, contingent on security/legal review, with phased rollout to avoid Q4 ops disruption         |
| **ICP Fit**     | Excellent – Mid-market DTC, Shopify Plus/Klaviyo stack, volume and workflow matches core segment                              |
| **Engagement**  | High – Responsive, detailed process, quick on follow-ups, clear KPIs and ownership                                            |

## Top Insights
- **Return rate pain:** 18.7% avg, peaking at 24% post-holiday, seriously impacting margin.
- **Manual workflow bottleneck:** Returns + refunds via spreadsheets and basic triage (Loop Returns); severely limits scale and speed.
- **Opportunity for automation/ML:** Machine learning decisioning and enhanced exchanges (target lift: 10–12 points) directly attack key metrics.
- **Integration criticality:** Redline WMS, Shopify Plus, NetSuite are all in play; S3/webhook options mitigate risk but need validation.
- **High stakeholder alignment and defined KPIs:** Rapid engagement, clear pilot milestones, strong SaaS and pilot funding, and willingness for measurable accountability.

## Blockers/Risks
- Security and privacy review (SOC 2, DPA) is a must-have, ~2–3 week timeline risk.
- Redline WMS API/data throughput unproven—possible delays/extra engineering.
- Warehouse ops disruption during Q4 peak must be avoided (phased launch only).
- All committee members (Jamie, Nora, Marta) must sign off; delays possible if any lose confidence or priorities shift.
- Contract must include pilot claw-back/discount if KPIs miss; legal review may introduce further negotiation.

## Unknowns
- Redline WMS integration specifics (API limits/batch, responsiveness).
- Quality/completeness of current returns/order data for ROI modeling and integration.
- Northbeam IT/warehouse bandwidth for quick technical collaboration.
- Potential Q4 operational projects that could compete for resources.

| **Tier**      |              |           | **Hot**           |

**Rationale:**  
Strong, urgent need and ICP fit with actively engaged decision makers and clear pilot funding; primary risk is in legal/security and integration, but process rigor and accountability mechanisms keep momentum high.

## Recommended Next Steps & Owners

1. **Send NDA + security pack (SOC 2, DPA, penetration summary, data flows)** to Northbeam legal/IT (Owner: AE)  
2. **Request 6+ months of returns/order data via S3** for ROI modeling and pilot sandbox (Owner: Northbeam Ops/IT)  
3. **Schedule/confirm technical working session** (already tentatively set) with Northbeam, Redline, and warehouse leads for integration mapping (Owner: AE)  
4. **Draft mutual Success Plan with clear KPIs, pilot claw-back terms, and risk mitigation for Q4 operations** (Owner: AE with Jamie/Marta)  
5. **Coordinate introductions to Redline and warehouse lead (Luis)** for integration risk discovery (Owner: Jamie/Northbeam)  
6. **Prepare for phased rollout/testing: integration in staging with selected SKUs/warehouses** (Owner: SE/Implementation)  
7. **Establish recurring communication/checkpoints** (weekly/biweekly) for real-time issue flagging and accountability (Owner: AE & Northbeam Ops)

### Supporting Quotes

- "Returns. They’re killing margin and creating chaos for ops. Our return rate averages 18.7%—peaks at 24% Jan–Feb after holiday gifting."
- "We’re doing too much in spreadsheets. We also need better demand forecasting for replenishment—SKU-level signals are noisy."
- "About 27% of returned units are resellable with no touch-ups, another ~40% need steaming/retagging, and the rest go to liquidation."
- "If we like the fit, pilot in 45–60 days. We’d need a short security review, legal’s DPA, and procurement."
- "Next steps I’m hearing: 1) We send NDA + security pack... 2) You drop a 6‑month sample of returns/order data via S3 so we build the ROI model..."
- "Two conditions: (1) security review including SOC 2 report and DPA, (2) pilot milestone with claw-back or discount if outcomes miss by a wide margin."

**Decision-Ready: Move immediately to documentation and technical alignment. Lead is Hot, highly actionable, but must clear legal/security and technical integration hurdles for pilot to proceed.**
