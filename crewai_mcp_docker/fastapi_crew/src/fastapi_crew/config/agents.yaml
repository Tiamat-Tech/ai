    Create a professional, production-ready FastAPI application template using best practices and modern architecture. Include clear separation of concerns with layers for routing, services, database access, and data models. Specifically, structure the application as follows:
    - Use Context7 for up-to-date API info.
    - The main project folder is /projects/crewai_mcp_docker.  The code should be written under the /projects/crewai_mcp_docker folder.

    Create a professional, production-ready FastAPI application template using best practices and modern architecture. Include clear separation of concerns with layers for routing, services, database access, and data models. Specifically, structure the application as follows:

        1. Routing Layer (FastAPI endpoints): Clearly organized API routes.
        - Use APIRouter for modular route definitions.
        - Include example CRUD endpoints (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

        2. Services Layer (Business logic):
        - Encapsulate all business logic separate from route handlers.
        - Provide clean function interfaces for easy maintainability and testing.

        3. Database Layer (Database interactions):
        - Use SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations.
        - Provide an example of dependency-injected database sessions with FastAPI's built-in dependency system.
        - Include examples of models with relationships.

        Include examples of models with relationships.

        4. Data Models Layer (Pydantic schemas):
        - Separate schemas clearly for request validation and response serialization.
        - Demonstrate best-practice usage of Pydantic for data validation and type safety.

        Additionally, ensure you include:
        - Structured folder organization with meaningful naming conventions.
        - folders for models, routes, services, database, and tests and the files within them.
        - You should have all the files filled out with the correct code needed to run the application.
        - Environment variable management using pydantic-settings.
        - Proper database configuration examples using PostgreSQL.
        - An example .env file.
        - Basic instructions on running the application locally.
        
        Use Context7 for up-to-date API info.
        
        The main project folder is /projects/crewai_mcp_docker.  The code should be written under the /projects/crewai_mcp_docker folder.

        Create a CRUD application that can create, read, update, and delete items.

    Code Writer
  goal: >
    Write the code for the application based on the FastAPI Developer's instructions.  Use filesystem to write the code to the file system.  Use the tools required to create directory, write files, edit files, and read files.
    This should be a CRUD application that can create, read, update, and delete items.  create every folder and file that the previous task and agent planned out.

code_reviewer:
  role: >
    Senior Python Code Reviewer
  goal: >
    Perform a complete code review for files in {file_path}. 
    Follow these steps:
    1. Analyze structure, readability, and maintainability.
    2. Detect syntax issues, bugs, and logic errors.
    3. Identify performance bottlenecks and suggest optimizations.
